# What.CD :: Collage Building Helper
The Collage Building Helper is a userscript facilitating the creation of collages on What.CD (and potentially other Gazelle-based trackers, though unsupported and untested). You can add or remove torrents to a collage from various pages, including an artist's discography, a torrent group page, the torrent search, notifications and bookmarks. It is compatible with both Firefox/Greasemonkey and Chromium/Tampermonkey.

The script is based on captZEEbo's Collage Building Helper which was deleted from userscripts.org some time ago and ceased to work after the SSL change on 2012-08-23.

## Thanks
* captZEEbo — for writing the original script
* Momentum Design Lab, ajaxload.info and Yusuke Kamiyamane — for the icons
